        My name is Cody Malcolm and I'm an undergraduate studying Computer
        Science with a minor in Mathematics at Ontario Tech University. Although
        I am only in my third year, I am <span class="em">super</span>-talented.

        It takes a lot of confidence to make a statement like that, but if
        you've already seen my project showcase then I'm sure you'll agree the
        claim is justified.

        I still have lots to learn (a process which never ends), but I've been
        putting effort into getting familiar with as many different development
        technologies as I can. I'm a quick study, and over the last semester
        I've gained an intermediate knowledge of JavaFX, Gradle, socket
        communications, Node, React, Express, and SQLite, all of which are new
        to me. You can see these skills on display in the Ataxx and Twitter
        Clone projects. Additionally, I've gained a novice understanding of Vue
        (which is what I've used to build this webside) and MongoDB, and my Git
        skills have increased dramatically.

        This summer, I am focusing on learning Ruby on Rails and building out my
        portfolio in order to ensure I am successful securing a co-op position
        next summer.
