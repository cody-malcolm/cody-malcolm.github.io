        My name is Cody Malcolm and I'm an undergraduate studying Computer
        Science with a minor in Mathematics at Ontario Tech University. Although
        I am only in my third year, I am <span class="em">super</span>-talented.

        It takes a lot of confidence to make a statement like that, but if
        you've already seen my project showcase then I'm sure you'll agree the
        claim is justified.

        I still have lots to learn (a process which never ends), but I'm a quick
        study and have been putting effort into getting familiar with as many different development
        technologies as I can.

        Recent additions include JavaFX, Gradle, socket communications, Node,
        React, Vue, Express, SQLite, and MongoDB. You can see many of these
        skills on display in the Ataxx and Twitter Clone projects. This summer,
        my primary focus will be Ruby on Rails and building out my portfolio.
