        I chose a minor in Mathematics because it's also important to me
        that the software I write is efficient, logically sound, and behaves
        as expected. For this, I've taken classes in Statistics, Discrete
        Mathematics, Computational Science, Optimization, and soon
        Probability - with demonstrated success comparable to
        that of my programming classes.
